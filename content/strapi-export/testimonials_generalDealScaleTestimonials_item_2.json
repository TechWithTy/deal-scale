  "content": "Before Deal Scale, our tech stack was a mess of disconnected tools. Now, our entire acquisitions process lives in one system. We find deals with the market data, qualify them with the AI agents, and manage everything in the Command Center. Itâ€™s the first platform that feels like it was actually built for a modern real estate investor.",
  "problem": "Our team used separate tools for lead lists, a clunky CRM, and manual outreach. Nothing was integrated, data was siloed, and our process was inefficient and difficult to scale.",
  "solution": "Deal Scale unified our entire workflow. We now have an integrated system for lead generation, data enrichment, multi-channel outreach, and pipeline management, all powered by intelligent automation.",
