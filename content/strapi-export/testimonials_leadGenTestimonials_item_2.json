  "content": "Expanding into a new city was daunting. We had no network and no data. Deal Scale was our secret weapon. We were able to generate targeted, high-quality lead lists for the entire metro area on day one. It saved us months of work and thousands in marketing waste. We closed our first deal in that market within 45 days, which is unheard of for us.",
  "problem": "Our small team was trying to scale into a new market but lacked the local knowledge and resources to build lead lists effectively, resulting in a very high cost-per-lead.",
  "solution": "Deal Scale allowed us to instantly generate qualified leads in the new market. This eliminated the usual ramp-up period, dramatically lowered our entry costs, and helped us close our first deal in record time.",
