  "content": "Being a solo operator, I'm always juggling tasks. I ran a campaign, and a week later, my phone rang. I answered, and it was the Deal Scale AI saying, 'I have a motivated seller for 123 Main St. on the line for you, press 1 to connect.' It seamlessly transferred a live, pre-vetted seller to me while I was walking through Home Depot. It's the most powerful tool I have.",
  "problem": "As a solo investor, every inbound call is critical, but I don't have a team to field them. I needed a way to qualify callers without stopping everything I was doing.",
  "solution": "The AI Agent with the live hot-transfer feature acts as my personal inbound sales team. It filters out tire-kickers and connects me directly to motivated sellers, saving me hours and letting me focus on closing deals.",
