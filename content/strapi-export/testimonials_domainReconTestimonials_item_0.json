  "content": "I used to go into cold calls with barely any information. Now, before I ever pick up the phone, I run a lead’s email or company website through Domain Recon. In seconds, I get a full picture—company size, social links, recent news, and even key decision makers. I can personalize my outreach, ask smarter questions, and prequalify leads faster. The conversations are so much warmer and my close rate has noticeably improved.",
  "problem": "Going into lead outreach blindly meant I missed key context, wasted time on unqualified prospects, and struggled to build rapport quickly.",
  "solution": "Domain Recon transforms a simple website into a detailed dossier—revealing company details, team members, and digital presence. I use these insights to prequalify leads and tailor my approach for each conversation.",
