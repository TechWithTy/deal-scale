  "question": "What happens when the AI finds a 'hot' lead that's ready to talk now?",
  "answer": "When the AI identifies a highly qualified and motivated lead, it can take multiple actions to maximize your chance of closing the deal. The AI can instantly schedule a calendar callback with the seller at a time that works for both of you, or book an in-person appraisal appointment directly on your calendar. If the seller is ready to talk immediately, the AI can also initiate a live hot transfer call, connecting them directly to you or your acquisition manager in real time. This ensures you never miss the hottest opportunities, whether you prefer a scheduled call, live conversation, or face-to-face meeting."
