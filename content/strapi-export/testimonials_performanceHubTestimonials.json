    "content": "This is two tools in one. First, I logged in and the AI had already added three 'First Contact' tasks for my new hire. Then, I added my own task: 'Send follow-up email to the lead from 123 Main St'. A second later, a button appeared: 'Let AI do this?'. I clicked yes, and it was done.

    "problem": "My day was a mix of strategic planning and being bogged down by repetitive administrative tasks.",
    "solution": "The AI Command Center acts as both a strategist—creating tasks for my team—and an assistant—automating the manual tasks I create for myself. It has fundamentally changed how I spend my time.",
