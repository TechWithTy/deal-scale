  "content": "The real magic happened when the calls came in from our postcard campaign. I was in a meeting and couldn't answer, but I got a notification that the AI had answered, qualified the seller, and booked an appointment right on my calendar for the next day. That one automated appointment turned into a $20k wholesale fee. It completely changed the ROI of our direct mail.",
  "problem": "Our direct mail efforts were a huge time sink, and worse, we were constantly missing calls from interested sellers when we were busy on other projects.",
  "solution": "Deal Scale not only automated the entire mailing process but also acted as our inbound receptionist and qualifier, ensuring every marketing dollar was maximized by converting calls into concrete appointments.",
