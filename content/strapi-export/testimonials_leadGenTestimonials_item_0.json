  "content": "Before Deal Scale, we were juggling three different list providers and still driving for dollars. It was a time-suck and our deal flow was a rollercoaster. Now, everything is in one place. The ability to pull a hyper-targeted list from their massive database in minutes is an absolute game-changer. Our pipeline has never been more consistent.",
  "problem": "Our team wasted countless hours and money on multiple, often outdated lead sources, which resulted in a very inconsistent and unpredictable deal flow.",
  "solution": "Deal Scale became our single source of truth. We now pull highly targeted lists from their 140M+ property database in minutes, not days, creating a predictable and steady pipeline.",
