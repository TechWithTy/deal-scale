    "question": "How is this different from just buying a list from PropStream, Deal Machine or BatchLeads?",
    "answer": "Those are great tools for data, but they only give you the 'what'—a list of contacts. Deal Scale provides the 'how': an autonomous AI agent that actually calls and texts that list for you, holds conversations, pre-qualifies the lead, and books a in person appraisal appointment directly on your calendar. We automate the entire top-of-funnel, not just the data gathering."

  {
    "question": "Is your skip tracing data accurate? And is it really unlimited?",
    "answer": "Yes, and yes. We pull from multiple top-tier data sources to ensure high accuracy for owner names, phone numbers, and property details. And our 'Unlimited Free Skip Tracing' is exactly that—unlimited for all subscribers. You can enrich as many leads as you need without worrying about skip-trace credits or monthly caps, which is a major cost-saving advantage."

  {
    "question": "Will sellers know they are talking to an AI? How does that work?",
    "answer": "Transparency is key. Our AI is designed to clearly identify itself as a virtual assistant. However, by using our Voice Cloning feature, the AI speaks in your authentic voice, which builds instant trust and rapport, leading to much higher engagement rates than a standard robotic-sounding AI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use my own lead lists or do I have to use yours?",
    "answer": "You can absolutely use your own lists. You can easily upload any CSV of leads you've acquired from other sources, and our AI agent will begin the outreach and qualification process. You can also generate new lists directly within Deal Scale using our 140M+ property database."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when the AI finds a 'hot' lead that's ready to talk now?",
    "answer": "When the AI identifies a highly qualified and motivated lead, it can take multiple actions to maximize your chance of closing the deal. The AI can instantly schedule a calendar callback with the seller at a time that works for both of you, or book an in-person appraisal appointment directly on your calendar. If the seller is ready to talk immediately, the AI can also initiate a live hot transfer call, connecting them directly to you or your acquisition manager in real time. This ensures you never miss the hottest opportunities, whether you prefer a scheduled call, live conversation, or face-to-face meeting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much time will this actually save me?",
    "answer": "Our clients report saving over 20 hours per week, per agent. By eliminating manual outbound prospecting and repetitive follow-ups, your team can stop chasing cold leads and focus exclusively on what they do best: talking to qualified sellers and closing deals."
  },
