  "content": "I got a lead from an anonymous username on a local Facebook real estate group. I didn't have a name or number. I plugged the username into the Social Profile Hunter, and it instantly found their LinkedIn, X, and personal blog. From LinkedIn, I got their full name and professional background. This turned an anonymous username into a fully qualified lead I could have a real conversation with.",
  "problem": "Leads from social media forums were often anonymous, making professional follow-up nearly impossible.",
  "solution": "The Social Profile Hunter transforms a single username into a complete digital dossier, providing the names and context needed to turn anonymous interest into a professional relationship.",
