    "problem": "Our expensive Meta Ad leads were going stale because our team couldn't follow up fast enough. We were wasting a significant portion of our ad budget.",
    "solution": "The moment a lead form is submitted, Deal Scale's AI is on it with texts and calls. It qualifies them and books appointments. Itâ€™s like having an always-on ISA for our ad spend and social pages.",

    "content": "The whitelabeled chat system for LinkedIn and Facebook has automated so much of our initial lead engagement. Then, the AI call follow-up seals the deal. It's a comprehensive lead nurturing machine.",
    "problem": "We were active on social media but struggled to consistently engage and follow up with every interaction, especially on LinkedIn. Meta Ad follow-up was also a manual bottleneck.",
    "solution": "Deal Scale provides automated chat flows for social, then AI calls and texts take over for deeper nurturing. Leads from ads and social are now managed end-to-end, leading to more qualified appointments.",
