  "content": "I'm an investor, not a data entry clerk. The grind of finding good off-market deals was killing my productivity. Deal Scale's platform is incredibly powerful. I can filter for the *exact* type of property I'm looking for and their AI scoring tells me who to call first. I'm now spending my time analyzing great deals, not looking for them.",
  "problem": "As a solo investor, I was spending over 80% of my time on the manual, tedious task of prospecting for off-market properties in a very competitive area.",
  "solution": "The platform's advanced filters and AI lead scoring allowed me to pinpoint exact property types and motivated sellers. It surfaces the top 10% of leads, so I can focus my energy on analysis and closing.",
