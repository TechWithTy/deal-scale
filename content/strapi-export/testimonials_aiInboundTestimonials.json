    "content": "We were losing deals to voicemail after 5 PM. The AI bot now catches them all. It qualified a seller at 9 PM on a Tuesday, and the appointment was on my calendar when I woke up. That single deal paid for the service for years to come.",
    "problem": "Our team couldn't answer calls 24/7, causing high-value leads from our marketing to go to voicemail and get lost after business hours.",
    "solution": "Deal Scale's AI answers every call, day or night. It successfully captured and qualified a motivated seller lead late in the evening, directly leading to a closed deal we would have otherwise missed.",

    "problem": "Our skilled front-desk staff was getting bogged down with repetitive, low-level calls, preventing them from focusing on high-priority operational tasks.",
    "solution": "The AI Agent automated the vast majority of routine inbound calls, acting as a perfect filter. This freed up our staff to manage more complex client needs, increasing overall team efficiency and morale.",
