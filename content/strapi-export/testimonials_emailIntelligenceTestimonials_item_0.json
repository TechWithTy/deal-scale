  "content": "We get leads from website forms, and it's hard to know who's real. With the Email Intelligence tool, I plugged in an email and immediately saw it was linked to an active Instagram and professional LinkedIn profile. This told me it was a real person and gave me instant context about their background before my call. It's a huge confidence booster.",
  "problem": "We were wasting time on outreach to unverified email addresses and lacked the context to personalize our messages effectively.",
  "solution": "The Email Intelligence tool allows us to instantly verify a lead's digital footprint by finding their social accounts, saving time and dramatically improving our ability to build rapport.",
