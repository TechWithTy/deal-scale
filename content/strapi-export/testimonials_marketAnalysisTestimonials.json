    "content": "The AI Market Analysis is my go-to due diligence tool. I can pull a report on a new zip code in seconds. The best part is arming my AI agent with it. The agent called a seller and mentioned that 'rents for 2-bedroom properties in your area have increased by 8% year-over-year.' That level of specific data, delivered automatically, is something no competitor can match. It builds instant credibility.",
    "problem": "It was difficult to quickly analyze new markets and even harder to convey that market expertise to potential sellers in a scalable way.",
    "solution": "The AI Market Analysis tool not only provides instant reports but allows me to feed those insights directly to my AI agents, who use the data to have more intelligent, persuasive conversations.",
