    "problem": "Our sales team was spending 70% of their time on cold outreach with very low success rates, trying to find and qualify leads themselves.",
    "solution": "The AI now handles all the front-end outbound work. It filters out the unqualified leads and delivers either booked appointments or live warm transfers. Our closers can now focus purely on selling to interested prospects.",

    "content": "The ability of the AI to not just qualify but also intelligently decide whether to book an appointment or attempt a hot transfer is incredible. It ensures we connect with hot leads instantly. The AI calls sound very natural too.",
    "problem": "We struggled with timely follow-up on outbound leads and often missed the window when a prospect was most interested. Scheduling was also a manual pain point.",
    "solution": "Deal Scale's AI acts immediately. It qualifies leads through natural AI calls and texts. If a lead is highly qualified and ready to talk, we get a hot transfer. Otherwise, it's a booked meeting. Itâ€™s a perfect system.",
