You’re going to use your content pages/blog to generate SEO value but I would also strategically include SEO content on your home page and other pages. Do not Keyword stuff. Use keywords purposefully throughout site.

Page titles: Include top keyword at the beginning of your title tag. Make sure each page has a unique tag that is relevant to that page
Headings: Use different levels of headings on each page (H1, H2, H3…). H1 is the main title of the page. Search engines will pick up the hierarchy.
Meta tag descriptions: describe what’s on the page including keywords
Body text: Sprinkle keywords throughout body text (paragraphs, bulleted lists)
Image text:
Links: use descriptive anchor text
URLs: include descriptive keywords in URLs

I suggest adding a brief section entitled something to the effect of “Our Philosophy” Create SEO rich-text around why we do what we do, how we help investors and the value this brings to our customers.
