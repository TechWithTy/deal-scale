# ServiceCard Height Debugging Log

## Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Removed Height and Stretch Classes**
   - Removed `h-full`, `min-h-full`, and any explicit height from `ServiceCard` root and grid container.
   - Ensured ServiceCard uses only necessary layout classes (e.g., `flex flex-col` or none).
   - Removed all row/grid stretch classes (`items-stretch`, `auto-rows-fr`, `grid-rows-[auto]`) from the grid container.

2. **Checked Parent Structure**
   - Verified that the parent `<section>` and `<div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto">` do not have any height, flex, or grid classes that would force children to stretch.

3. **Inspected in Browser DevTools**
   - Used DevTools to inspect the computed styles of ServiceCard and its parent containers.
   - Looked for any ancestor with `height: 100%`, `min-height: 100%`, `flex: 1`, or `display: flex` with `align-items: stretch`.

4. **Reviewed Global and Layout CSS**
   - Checked for global CSS or Tailwind config rules that might target `.grid > *` or similar selectors and force `height: 100%`.

5. **Tested with Debug Backgrounds**
   - Temporarily added background colors to the grid and ServiceCard to visualize which element was stretching.

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Check Higher-Level Layouts**
   - Inspect page-level layouts or wrappers (e.g., `layout.tsx`, `_app.tsx`, or parent sections) for any flex/grid/height classes.
   - Remove or adjust any `h-full`, `min-h-full`, `flex-1`, or `flex` with `items-stretch` from ancestors.

2. **Review Global Styles**
   - Examine `globals.css` or Tailwind config for rules that force child elements of grid/flex containers to stretch.
   - Search for selectors like `.grid > *` or `.flex > *`.

3. **DevTools Deep Dive**
   - In the browser, select a ServiceCard and use the "Computed" panel to trace which ancestor is contributing a forced height.
   - Remove or override the offending style.

4. **Test with Minimal Layout**
   - Render the grid and ServiceCard in a minimal page with no extra wrappers to confirm the issue is not in the component itself.

5. **If Still Unresolved**
   - Share the layout/global CSS or ancestor JSX tree for further review.
   - Consider using `!h-auto` or `!min-h-0` on the grid and ServiceCard as a last resort to override inherited styles.

---

**Summary:**
- The ServiceCard and grid are now correct for content-based height. If cards are still stretching, the issue is almost certainly from a parent container or global style. Use DevTools and the steps above to isolate and resolve the root cause.
