## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database setup (if needed)
- [ ] Content folder excluded from deployment
- [ ] Build process tested locally
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] SSL certificate configured (for custom domains)

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Content Folder**: Always exclude `content/` and `strapi-export/` from deployments
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to git
- **Build Output**: Use appropriate output directory (`out/`, `dist/`, etc.)
- **Database**: For production, use managed databases (Supabase, MongoDB Atlas, etc.)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Check Node.js version (use 20.x)
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check for missing environment variables

### Deployment Errors
- Verify ignore files are correct
- Check platform-specific limits (file size, etc.)
- Ensure build output exists
