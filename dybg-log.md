# Debug Log

## Summary
- Investigated Vercel build failure for commit e14dbb6 on branch `codex/update-type-inference-in-usedatamodulestore`.
- Build succeeded through dependency installation and Next.js compilation but failed during type checking due to a generic narrowing issue in `src/stores/useDataModuleStore.ts`.

## What Worked
- `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` executed successfully during both cache restore and build phases.
- Next.js `next build` compiled application bundles without runtime compilation errors before type checking.
- Jest unit suite (`pnpm exec jest src/stores/__tests__/useDataModuleStore.test.ts`) passed locally, confirming runtime store behavior under mocked manifest entries.

## What Didn't Work
- TypeScript type checking in the build pipeline aborted with error TS2322 at `src/stores/useDataModuleStore.ts:53:31` because the manifest entry cast to `DataManifestEntry<K>` introduced an incompatible `key` literal type (`"about/hero"` not assignable to `K`).
- The promise resolution handler received a module typed as the full manifest intersection instead of the requested `K`, causing downstream assignment failures.

## Follow-up Actions
- Relax the direct annotation on `dataManifest[key]` and re-introduce narrowing via a post-lookup assertion that preserves the key-specific loader type.
- Re-run `pnpm run build` to ensure type checking passes after narrowing adjustments.
- Maintain the regression tests that validate `createDataModuleStore("medium/post")` exposes the correct module shape.
