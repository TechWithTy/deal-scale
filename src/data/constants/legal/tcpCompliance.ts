# TCPA Compliance

**Last Updated: July 15, 2025**

### Our Commitment to Compliance

Deal Scale is fully committed to complying with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. § 227. Our policies are designed to ensure that we respect the privacy of consumers and adhere to all legal requirements for telephone and text message communications.

### Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC)

We operate on the principle of **Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC)** for all marketing communications sent using an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS) or an artificial or prerecorded voice, including our AI 'Virtual Agents'.

For consent to be valid, it must meet the following criteria:

1.  **Clear and Conspicuous Disclosure:** You must be clearly informed that you are agreeing to receive marketing calls and/or text messages from or on behalf of Deal Scale.
2.  **Technology Mentioned:** The disclosure must state that an autodialer, AI, and/or prerecorded voice may be used.
3.  **Number Provided by You:** You must provide the phone number to which the calls/texts will be sent.
4.  **Not a Condition of Purchase:** The disclosure must explicitly state that **"consent is not a condition of any purchase."**
5.  **Affirmative Action:** You must take a clear affirmative action to consent, such as checking a box that is **not** pre-checked.

### How We Obtain Consent

We obtain PEWC through compliant methods across all our channels:

-   **Webforms & Landing Pages:** Every form includes TCPA-compliant language and an un-checked checkbox for consent.
-   **Social Media Ads:** We use custom disclaimer fields to include the required disclosure.
-   **Chat & Automated Follow-ups:** We use a "double opt-in" process where you must explicitly agree to receive marketing messages.

### Operational Safeguards

-   **Internal Do-Not-Call (DNC) List:** We maintain and honor an internal DNC list. Any request to stop receiving communications (e.g., replying "STOP," verbal requests) is processed immediately.
-   **AI Agent Identification:** Our AI agents will always clearly identify themselves as an AI at the beginning of a call.
-   **Time of Day Restrictions:** We only place calls and send texts between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM in the recipient's local time zone.
-   **Record Keeping:** We maintain meticulous records of all consent obtained, including timestamps and the specific source of the consent, as proof of compliance.

### User-Uploaded Data and Certification of Consent

If you manually upload or import leads or contact lists into the Deal Scale platform, you hereby certify and warrant that you have obtained Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC) from each individual on your list, in full compliance with the TCPA.

Failure to secure and document proper consent is a direct violation of our Terms of Service. You agree to indemnify and hold Deal Scale harmless from any and all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including but not limited to legal fees and costs incurred in the state of Delaware, arising from your non-compliance with this obligation.

### Your Right to Opt-Out

Leads have the right to revoke their consent and opt-out of our communications at any time through any reasonable means. Every text message includes clear opt-out instructions (e.g., "Reply STOP to end").
