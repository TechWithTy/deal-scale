### 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the services of Deal Scale ("we," "us," "our"), including our website, AI-powered agents, and lead generation platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms") and our [Privacy Policy](#/legal/privacy). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our services.

### 2. Description of Services

Deal Scale provides AI-powered real estate lead generation and data enrichment services. Our platform is designed to supply our clients with sales-ready leads by collecting and processing data from public records, client submissions, and other lawful sources. Communication with leads may occur via direct mail, telephone, and text messages, facilitated by our AI 'Virtual Agents'.

### 3. User Obligations and Conduct

You agree to use our services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:

- Use our services in any way that violates federal, state, or local laws, including the Fair Housing Act and data privacy statutes.
- Provide any data to us for which you do not have the legal right or necessary consent to do so.
- Attempt to interfere with the proper working of our services, including by scraping data in violation of platform Terms of Service or attempting to access non-public information.

### 4. User-Uploaded Leads and TCPA Certification

**Important:** If you intend to upload, import, or otherwise provide your own leads to Deal Scale, you **must first consult with your legal representative** to ensure full compliance with all applicable laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and data privacy regulations.

By uploading leads, you represent and warrant that you have obtained Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC) from each individual, in strict compliance with the TCPA. Failure to do so is a material breach of these Terms and may expose you and your organization to significant legal and monetary penalties.

**Warning:** Uploading leads without proper consent may result in:
- Substantial fines, penalties, and legal actions by regulatory authorities.
- Full liability for all resulting costs, damages, and legal fees, including those incurred by Deal Scale, adjudicated in the State of Delaware.
- Immediate suspension or termination of your account and services.

If you are unsure about your compliance obligations, do not upload any leads and seek legal counsel immediately.

### 5. Consent for Communications (TCPA)

By providing your phone number and giving your prior express written consent through our webforms, social media ads, or other channels, you agree to be contacted by Deal Scale and its affiliates for marketing purposes. This contact may be made using an automatic telephone dialing system, an artificial or prerecorded voice (including our AI agents), and/or text messages.

- Your consent is not a condition of any purchase.
- You may revoke your consent at any time by replying "STOP" to any text message or through any other reasonable means.
- For full details on our communication practices, please see our [Privacy Policy](#/legal/privacy).

### 7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

Our services are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind. While we strive for accuracy, we do not warrant that the data provided will be error-free or that the service will be uninterrupted.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Deal Scale shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, resulting from your use of our services.

### 8. Indemnification

### 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.

### 10. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of our services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
