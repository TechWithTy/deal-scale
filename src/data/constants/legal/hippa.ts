# HIPAA Compliance Statement

**Last Updated: July 15, 2025**

### Our Commitment to Protecting Health Information

Deal Scale is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Protected Health Information (PHI) in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This statement outlines our responsibilities as a Business Associate when handling PHI on behalf of our clients (Covered Entities).

### 1. Scope and Definitions

- **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Any individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium.
- **Business Associate (BA):** Deal Scale acts as a Business Associate when we create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity.
- **Covered Entity (CE):** Our clients who are healthcare providers, health plans, or healthcare clearinghouses.

### 2. Use and Disclosure of PHI

Deal Scale will only use or disclose PHI as permitted or required by our Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the Covered Entity and as required by law. We will not use or disclose PHI in any manner that would violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule if done by the Covered Entity.

Key uses include:

- Performing our contractual duties as outlined in the BAA.
- For our own management and administration, and to carry out our legal responsibilities.

### 3. Safeguards for PHI

We have implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI (ePHI) that we create, receive, maintain, or transmit.

- **Technical Safeguards:** Include access controls, encryption of data in transit and at rest, and audit controls.
- **Physical Safeguards:** Include facility access controls and secure workstation use.
- **Administrative Safeguards:** Include a designated Security Officer, risk management policies, and workforce training on HIPAA and security protocols.

### 4. Data Breach Notification

In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, we will notify the Covered Entity without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. Our notification will include the identification of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during the breach.

### 5. Subcontractors

We will ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on our behalf agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to us with respect to such information.
