# PII Handling Policy

**Last Updated: July 15, 2025**

### 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy outlines the principles and procedures for the secure and responsible handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by Deal Scale. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to PII collected by our company.

### 2. Definition of PII

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses
- Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
- Financial information (credit card numbers, bank account numbers)
- Health information (Protected Health Information or PHI)
- IP addresses and other online identifiers

### 3. PII Handling Principles

- **Data Minimization:** We will only collect, use, and retain the minimum amount of PII necessary to achieve our specified business purposes.
- **Purpose Limitation:** PII will only be processed for the legitimate and specified purposes for which it was collected.
- **Use, Retention, and Disposal:** PII will be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose and will be securely disposed of in accordance with our data retention schedule.

### 4. Data Security and Protection

We are committed to protecting PII through robust security measures:

- **Encryption:** All PII is encrypted both in transit (using TLS) and at rest.
- **Access Control:** Access to PII is strictly limited to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis. We enforce the principle of least privilege.
- **PCI DSS Compliance:** For all payment card information, we adhere strictly to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Where we handle Protected Health Information (PHI), we comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security and privacy rules.

### 5. Data Breach Response

In the event of a data breach involving PII, we will follow our established Incident Response Plan, which includes:

1.  Immediate containment of the breach.
2.  Assessment of the scope and impact.
3.  Notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities as required by law.
4.  Post-incident review to prevent future occurrences.

### 6. Employee Training

All employees with access to PII are required to complete regular training on data privacy and security to ensure they understand their responsibilities under this policy and applicable laws.
