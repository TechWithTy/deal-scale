		question: "Where does your lead data come from?",
		answer:
			"Our platform aggregates data from a multitude of public and private sources, including county records, tax assessments, and other proprietary data providers. This gives us a comprehensive database of over 140 million on-market and off-market properties across the U.S.",
	},
	{
		question:
			"How is this different from just buying lists from a list broker?",
		answer:
			"Deal Scale is a dynamic, all-in-one platform, not a static list provider. While list brokers provide a one-time data dump that quickly becomes outdated, our database is constantly updated. Furthermore, our AI-powered filters and lead scoring allow you to build highly targeted, high-potential lists on demand and seamlessly push them into automated outreach campaigns. It's the difference between being handed a phone book and being given a GPS that leads you directly to the best deals. [1, 2, 3]",
	},
	{
		question: "How does the AI Lead Scoring work?",
		answer:
			"Our AI analyzes thousands of data points for each property, including ownership history, loan information, local market trends, and other behavioral indicators. It then assigns a score based on the likelihood of the owner being a motivated seller, allowing you to prioritize your outreach and focus on the leads most likely to convert. [3, 4, 5]",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I target a specific neighborhood or zip code?",
		answer:
			"Absolutely. Our platform allows for granular geographic targeting. You can define your search area by state, county, city, zip code, or even by drawing a custom shape on a map to create hyper-local lead lists tailored to your investment strategy.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is this service suitable for a new investor or wholesaler?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Deal Scale is designed to help both new and experienced professionals. For new investors, it dramatically shortens the learning curve and eliminates the need for manual prospecting, providing instant access to high-quality leads. For experienced teams, it provides the tools to scale operations, enter new markets, and create a more predictable and efficient deal pipeline. [4]",
	},
	{
		question: "How fresh is the data?",
		answer:
			"Our data is updated on a continuous basis. We sync with our providers regularly to ensure you have the most current ownership information, property details, and contact data available, which is crucial for maximizing your connection rates and ROI.",

				"One credit is consumed each time our AI performs a significant action on your behalf. This includes sending a message, looking up information from a database to answer a question, or executing a step in a workflow (like a follow-up). This granular, usage-based model ensures you only pay for the specific work the AI is actively doing to qualify and nurture your leads.",
		},
		{
			question: "Do I have to build the conversation flows myself?",
			answer:
				"No, and that's the key advantage for most users. You simply activate our pre-built, AI-optimized conversation flows that have been expertly designed to qualify real estate leads. However, for teams with highly specific needs, our Enterprise plan provides the tools to fully customize these flows or build your own from the ground up.",
		},
		{
			question: "What happens when the AI qualifies a lead?",
			answer:
				"Our AI's work is just beginning. It will continue to nurture the lead with intelligent follow-ups. When the lead shows high intent and is ready to talk, the AI will either (1) find an open slot on your calendar and book the appointment directly, or (2) initiate a live phone call and transfer the warm lead directly to you.",

		},
		{
			question:
				"Can the system automatically stop sending mail to someone who calls me?",

			question: "How accurate is the owner's name?",

		},
		{
			question: "What is a 'subdomain' and why is it useful?",

		},
		{
			question: "How is this different from just searching on Google?",
			answer:
				"While Google is powerful, our tool automates the process of checking a specific username or email against a curated list of over 600 websites, including many that may not rank high in search results. It's faster, more comprehensive, and specifically designed for this task.",
		},
		{

It's how we build a complete 360-degree view.",

		},
		{
			question: "What does it mean to 'Arm Your Agents'?",

				"The AI **adds** tasks proactively when it analyzes your pipeline and spots an opportunity you might have missed (e.g., 'Lead has gone cold, follow up!'). It **completes** tasks after you manually create one (e.g., you write 'Send comps to John'), and the AI recognizes it has the capability to perform that action for you.",

		{
			question: "How does the AI know it can complete a task I write?",
			answer:
				"Our AI is trained to recognize specific action-oriented phrases. When you write a task like 'Send follow-up text to Jane' or 'Find comps for 456 Oak Ave', the AI identifies these keywords and, if it has the necessary data, will offer to execute the task for you.",

			question:
				"What makes Deal Scale's Voice Cloning superior to standard text-to-speech (TTS) voices?",

		{
			question: "How does the pricing work?",
			answer:
				"Our model is simple. You pay a low, flat monthly fee for your dedicated AI-powered phone number. Then, you use flexible 'AI Credits' to pay for the time the AI is actively engaged on a call (2 credits per minute). There are no hidden fees.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I use my existing business phone number?",
			answer:
				"Yes, absolutely. You can simply forward your existing business line to your new Deal Scale AI number. Your customers continue to call the number they already know, and our AI handles the rest seamlessly.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can the AI transfer a call to a live person?",
			answer:
				"Yes. You can configure rules for when a live transfer should occur. For example, a caller can request to speak to a human, or the AI can offer to transfer the call to a specific department or team member if it cannot handle the request.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"What happens if a caller has a very specific or complex question?",
			answer:
				"The AI is trained to recognize the limits of its knowledge. If it encounters a question it can't answer, its primary goal is to intelligently route the caller. It can offer to schedule a call with the right expert or perform a hot transfer to a live agent immediately.",
